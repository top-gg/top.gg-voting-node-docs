Once you've configured Top.gg and add the library to your code you can start receiving test votes and votes!\
\
Its often easier to start with test votes.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find the test vote button the the edit page of your bot or server.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Adding the test event" %}

```javascript
// This code will log a new test vote in console, with the vote data.
topgg.on("testVote", (vote) => {
  console.log(`test vote event: ${JSON.stringify(vote)}`);
});
```

{% endcode %}

### Once you've made sure you can receive test votes you can move on to real votes!

You can use this event to send the user a message on vote with discordJS(or any library!)\
You can also give rewards here.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="DiscordJS" %}

```javascript
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require("discord.js");
const { VotingSDK } = require("@top-gg/voting-sdk");

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });
client.login("token");

const topgg = new VotingSDK("authorization");

topgg.on("vote", async (vote) => {
  console.log(vote);
  const user = await client.users.fetch(user);
  user.send("We received your vote!");
});

topgg.init();
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
